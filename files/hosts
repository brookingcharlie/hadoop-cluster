# We remove Ubuntu's default entry, "127.0.1.1 $(hostname)" to avoid a Connection
# Refused Exception. From the Hadoop Wiki: "Check that there isn't an entry for
# your hostname mapped to 127.0.0.1 or 127.0.1.1 in /etc/hosts (Ubuntu is notorious
# for this)" [https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/ConnectionRefused].
